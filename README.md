# Data-Cleaning-Project
This project utilizes  a data set from Dataquest and I use Python and Pandas library in order to clean and analyze this data about cars from Ebay. This was also a part of the Dataquest Data Scientist Path and I extended the analysis using Pandas to answer some more questions from the dataset.
